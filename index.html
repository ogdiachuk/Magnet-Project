        <p>
            There is a theory that using the magnetic push and resistance,
            you can create a source of energy that would last forever.
            While researching this topic I noticed that a lot of these theories are just that, theories, it's incredibly hard to prove ANYTHING
            when there are so many hoaxes on the internet and some people say that scientists have already figured it out
            but the oil and gas billion dollar companies are paying them off to not release that inform to the public.
             I will explain the reasons it is possible,
            and the reasons it isn’t.

      <h3 class="card__title">Reasons Why It Is</h3>
      <p>
    If you think about it, it makes sense that you could create infinite energy using magnets.
     If you placed à piece of circular plastic or other materials on a spinning engine or motor (Of course the motor would only be for allowing the plastic or other materials to spin,
     and also for creating the friction and would never be on) and put magnets north side up on it in à certain way and then put magnets above it with north side down,
      then the friction of the motor attached to wires would create different amounts of energy depending on how strong the magnets are and how fast they are spinning the motor.

      <h3 class="card__title">Reasons Why It Is Not</h3>
      <p>
          The reason that people say that you can’t create infinite energy,
           is because it's the second law of thermodynamics.
           Energy is conserved in any closed system, so you're motor always needs an energy input,
           but I think that the magnets are the input,
           like I said I don’t really know whether it’s possible or not.
